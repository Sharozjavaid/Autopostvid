    "script": "Imagine watching your entire life sink into the dark, unforgiving ocean. That is exactly what happened to Zeno, a wealthy merchant who had everything to lose. In a single violent storm, his ship, his vast fortune, and his planned future were destroyed. He washed ashore in Athens with nothing but the wet clothes on his back. Most men would scream at the heavens in despair. But Zeno did something strange. He wandered into a bookstore and discovered the words of Socrates. There, he realized a profound truth: while the sea could take his gold, it could never touch his mind. He began teaching on a painted porch, or 'Stoa,' sharing that true power isn't controlling the world, but controlling your reaction to it. You don't need a shipwreck to find this kind of unshakeable peace. The wisdom of the ages is waiting for you right now. Dive deeper into philosophy with our app.",
