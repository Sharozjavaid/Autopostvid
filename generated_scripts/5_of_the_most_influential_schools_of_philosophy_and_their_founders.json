    "script": "Have you ever felt a sudden shiver, suspecting the world isn't quite what it seems? You are walking a path traveled by giants. Plato stood at the mouth of a dark cave, warning that you might be watching mere shadows while the brilliant truth awaits outside. Aristotle examined the complexity of nature, insisting that a specific purpose lives within you, just as an acorn holds the blueprint of a mighty oak. When life became a storm, Zeno and the Stoics built an unshakeable fortress within the mind, proving peace is a choice, not a circumstance. Lao Tzu simply watched the water flow, teaching that true strength comes from softness and moving with nature's ancient rhythm. And Sartre placed the universe in your hands, revealing you are terrifyingly free to design your own soul. The journey is yours. Dive deeper into philosophy with our app.",
