Imagine a demon creeps up to you right now and whispers: 'This life you live, you must live it once more and innumerable times more.' Every pain, every joy, every mistake, and this exact second\u2014repeated infinitely forever. There is nothing new. Just the same movie on loop. Would you throw yourself down and scream in horror? Or would you welcome it? Here is the twist: Nietzsche didn't say this is actually true. He designed it as the ultimate test of your character. If the thought scares you, you need to change your path. The goal is to become the Superman\u2014someone who loves life so much they would crave the infinite replay. Don't just survive time, conquer it. Dive deeper into philosophy with our app.",
