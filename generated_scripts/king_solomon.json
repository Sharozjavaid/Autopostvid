    "title": "King Solomon",
    "script": "Imagine standing in the heavy silence of an ancient throne room. Two desperate mothers kneel before King Solomon, both claiming the same living child. How do you discern the truth when every word could be a lie? The King makes a terrifying decree: \"Cut the child in two.\" The sword rises. One woman accepts this brutal fairness, content with half. But the real mother cries out, \"No! Give him to her!\" In that instant, the mask falls. Solomon knew that true love prefers to lose everything rather than see its beloved destroyed. He wasn't testing their logic; he was testing their hearts. Wisdom is more than knowledge; it is the ability to see the invisible threads of human nature. Are you ready to look beyond the surface?
