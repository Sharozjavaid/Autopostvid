    "script": "Imagine having boiling oil spilled on your bare skin and not even flinching. This actually happened to the most powerful man in the world, Marcus Aurelius. He was relaxing in a bath when a nervous slave slipped. A heavy pitcher of scalding hot oil crashed down, burning the Emperor\u2019s chest. The room went silent. Guards drew their swords. The slave fell to his knees, waiting for death. But Marcus didn\u2019t scream. He didn\u2019t rage. He took a deep breath, looked at the shaking boy, and simply said: \"It seems you have spilled the oil.\" That\u2019s it. Marcus knew that anger wouldn't heal his burns. It would only poison his soul. You cannot control what happens to you, only how you respond. So next time the world burns you, don't add fuel to the fire. Stay cool.",
