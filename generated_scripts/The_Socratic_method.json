    "script": "The most annoying man in history invented a mind-hack so powerful, the government executed him for it. It\u2019s called the Socratic Method. While everyone else screams their opinions, Socrates did the opposite. He played dumb. He asked simple questions like 'What is justice?' or 'What is courage?' When people answered, he didn't fight back. He asked another question. And another. Until their entire argument fell apart. It\u2019s verbal jiu-jitsu. You don\u2019t attack the person; you let them destroy their own logic. By the end, they think the truth was their idea all along. Next time you disagree, stop preaching. Start asking. True power isn't forcing an answer; it\u2019s controlling the questions.",
